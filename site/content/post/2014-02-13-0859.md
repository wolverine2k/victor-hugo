<p>I have created a tool in my free time for duplicating repo functionality on windows without using the cygwin. Cygwin basically emulates Linux ABIs on windows and is prone to errors. My tool is using native windows binaries so no ABI translation is needed.</p> <p>The tool is available for download at: <a href="https://github.com/wolverine2k/win-repo/tree/master/releases">https://github.com/wolverine2k/win-repo/tree/master/releases</a>. The instructions for configuration are available at: <a href="https://github.com/wolverine2k/win-repo">https://github.com/wolverine2k/win-repo</a> </p> <p>The tool is a WIP but still the repo init and syncs are working great. Please do spread the information as needed.</p> <p>If you are open to contribution, do drop me an email! </p> <p>README available on <a title="https://github.com/wolverine2k/win-repo" href="https://github.com/wolverine2k/win-repo">https://github.com/wolverine2k/win-repo</a></p>
