My previous article <a href="http://t.co/XamFah9e8V">http://t.co/XamFah9e8V</a> shows how to install Microsoft XNA 4.0 refresh without VS 2010 for VS2013. In the meantime, Microsoft is kind enough to release a Community Preview version of VS 2015. And boy it looks amazing. It is fast, has a lot of functionality, and I basically am in love with it! Also Microsoft has released VS 2013 Community Edition which again is amazing. In short, Microsoft is going a very long way to please individual developers/hobbyists like me to lure them back to developing Windows (Store/Phone/Game) Apps. And I am happy that they are doing it. But back to the topic, installing XNA 4.0 refresh is a breeze for VS2015 as well. Of course we need to change the script a little bit. So here it is.
