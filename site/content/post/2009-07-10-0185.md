<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html" target="_blank">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html</a> Google announces the Google chrome OS which is pretty much a web-based OS. I guess would be much like Palm Pre in that sense. I was wondering when Android will start fragmentation. Looks like 2nd half 2010 or 1st half 2011 as of now ;)

But exciting as it is, lets see how Google jumps into the already competitive desktop OS market. It would definitely be a blow to MS Windows but would it be able to nudge *nix based distros? Lets see if it just remains another of the 300+ distribution or comes above/below ubuntu. (<a href="http://www.distrowatch.com/" target="_blank">http://www.distrowatch.com/</a>) Wait &amp; Watch and see how it turns up and if Google will canibalize Android for Chrome or vice-versa. Interesting times to come...
