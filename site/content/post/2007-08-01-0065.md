A turkey was chatting with a bull. "I would love to be able to get to the top  of that tree," sighed the turkey, "but I haven't got the energy."

"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull.  "They're packed with nutrients."

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave him enough  strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eatingsome  more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night,the turkey  was proudly perched at the top of the tree.

He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot him out of the  tree.

<strong>Moral of the story:</strong>
<strong>Bull Shit might get you  to the top, but it won't keep you there.</strong>
